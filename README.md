# Tether

Tether is a Google Drive sync plugin for Obsidian that keeps your vault structure in sync using your own Google Cloud project and Google account.

> Pull notes from Google Drive first, then push local changes back as Drive revisions.

## Why Tether

Tether is built for people who want a self-managed sync workflow across desktop and mobile-compatible Obsidian setups without relying on shared credentials. It creates a dedicated folder for your vault in Google Drive, keeps the folder structure intact, and separates pull and push actions so each direction is predictable.

## Highlights

| Feature | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Full-vault sync | Syncs notes, attachments, nested folders, and the `.obsidian` folder |
| Directional sync | Pull from Google Drive or push local changes with separate commands and sidebar buttons |
| Your own credentials | Uses your Google Cloud OAuth client instead of a shared backend |
| Mobile-friendly networking | Uses Obsidian's `requestUrl` API for Google OAuth and Drive requests |
| Built-in setup flow | Includes an in-app setup guide, login flow, folder picker, and sync status sidebar |
| Automatic syncing | Supports sync on startup and interval-based background sync |

## How it works

1. Create your own Google Cloud OAuth app.
2. Paste your client ID and client secret into Tether.
3. Sign in with Google from inside Obsidian.
4. Choose a Google Drive folder for Tether to use.
5. Tether creates a vault-named folder inside that Drive folder and keeps both sides in sync.

## Installation

### Community Plugins

Once Tether is approved in the Obsidian Community Plugins directory:

1. Open `Settings -> Community plugins`.
2. Select `Browse` and search for `Tether`.
3. Install the plugin and enable it.

### Manual installation

Until the community listing is live, you can install Tether manually:

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the latest release.
2. Create the folder `.obsidian/plugins/tether/` inside your vault.
3. Copy the three files into that folder.
4. Reload Obsidian.
5. Enable `Tether` under `Settings -> Community plugins`.

## Quick start

1. Open the Tether settings tab in Obsidian.
2. Select `Open Guide` if you want the in-app screenshot walkthrough.
3. Add your Google Cloud `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
4. Select `Open Login Page`, sign in with Google, and paste the returned URL into `Authorization URL`.
5. Choose the Google Drive folder you want Tether to use.
6. Run `Pull from Google Drive` for the first sync, then use `Push to Google Drive` for local changes.

## iOS setup

If you already have Tether working on another device, the easiest iOS setup is to transfer the entire vault locally instead of configuring everything again on the phone or iPad.

1. From a device where Tether is already working, send or AirDrop the full vault to the iOS device.
2. Make sure the transfer includes the `.obsidian` folder so the plugin settings come with it.
3. In the Files app, move the vault into the Obsidian folder on the iOS device.
4. Open that vault in Obsidian.
5. Tether should continue from the existing setup. If Google asks you to authenticate again, open Tether settings and sign in again.

## Commands

- `Run Next Tether Sync`
- `Pull from Google Drive`
- `Push to Google Drive`
- `Open Sync Status Sidebar`

## Sync behavior

- Tether syncs Markdown notes, attachments, nested folders, and the `.obsidian` folder.
- Tether creates a dedicated vault folder inside the Google Drive folder you select.
- The first automatic sync pulls from Google Drive. Later automatic syncs push local changes to Google Drive.
- Pull replaces local files with the Google Drive version, while deferring open or recently edited local files.
- Pull mirrors remote deletions locally; push mirrors local deletions to Google Drive.
- Push updates existing Google Drive files so Drive keeps revisions instead of creating duplicate sibling files.
- Tether checks each Drive folder for duplicate same-name files, folds differing duplicate content into the chosen file's Drive revision history, then removes the extra Drive files.
- Tether excludes `.git`, `.trash`, and its own sync state file at `.obsidian/gdrive-sync.json`.

## Compatibility

- Minimum Obsidian version: `0.15.0`
- Plugin id: `tether`
- Manifest setting: `isDesktopOnly: false`
- Designed for desktop and mobile-compatible Obsidian environments.
- Sync and auth network calls use Obsidian's `requestUrl` API and avoid Node/Electron-only APIs in the mobile path.
- Sign-in opens Google in the system browser and accepts either the redirected URL or authorization code. A fully automatic OAuth return into Obsidian on every desktop and mobile platform would require an owned HTTPS redirect flow, native platform clients, or a small backend.

## Privacy, security, and disclosures

- Tether requires a Google account and your own Google Cloud project.
- Tether does not ship with shared Google credentials.
- Tether connects to Google OAuth and Google Drive APIs.
- Tether requests these Google scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly`, `openid`, and `email`.
- Tether stores your access token, refresh token, selected folder, and plugin settings in local Obsidian plugin data.
- Tether stores sync state in `.obsidian/gdrive-sync.json`.
- Tether reads and writes files in your vault, including `.obsidian`, in order to synchronize content.
- No ads, telemetry, or third-party analytics are used in the current plugin code.
- Tether is not affiliated with Google or Obsidian.

### Disclosures

- Plugin might make requests to 5 external domains: `accounts.google.com`, `oauth2.googleapis.com`, `obsidian.md`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`, and `www.googleapis.com`.
- Clipboard access: reads or writes the system clipboard, which may expose content the user copied from outside Obsidian.
- Found `atob()`/`btoa()` base64 calls (2 total), which may be used to obscure strings.
- Vault read: reads individual vault files via the Obsidian API (`vault.read`, `vault.cachedRead`).
- Vault write: creates or modifies vault files via the Obsidian API (`vault.modify`, `vault.create`, etc.).
- Malware scan not available.
- Obfuscation scan not available.
- Network requests scan not available.
